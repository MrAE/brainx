Global Brain Workshop April 7-8 2016 at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, MD; sponsored by NSF & Kavli


Dear Invited Guest:

Below is the stock email I sent to everybody regarding the above upcoming Global Brain Workshop. 
I think it is particularly important that you attend both as a representative of European neuroscience, and because the PLI technology and BigBrain are possible spring boards upon which to launch much larger initiatives.
I know this is relatively last minute, please let me know if there is anything I can do to help persuade you to attend?

Best,
Joshua


*****************


You are cordially invited to attend A Scientific Planning Workshop for Coordinating Brain Research Around the Globe on April 7th & 8th 2016 at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD USA. The purpose of this workshop is to come together - as representatives of global neuroscience - to brainstorm and generate plans for how national, transnational and private brain programs can coordinate efforts to accomplish something synergistic and magnanimous across brain programs. Importantly, these plans will guide the content of an Autumn conference focused on facilitating international neuroscience collaborations, to be held at the UN during the General Assembly and hosted by the National Science Foundation and the Kavli Foundation.


The April meeting will consist of a series of very brief talks (open to the community), followed by intense group discussions, with ample breaks for discussion. All travel, lodging, and food will be provided. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to attend, share your insights, listen to othersâ€™ insights, and help forge a set a consensus ideas. Invitees span all continents, and range from academia, government, the private sector, and industry, with very diverse skills and interests. For more details of the event, navigate to http://brainx.io. 

Given the short notice, we humbly request your prompt RSVP by filling out this registration form (http://goo.gl/forms/5FSxdppkAB) as soon as possible.
